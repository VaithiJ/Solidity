# Solidity
My first smart contract created using solidity language.

FAVOURITE MARVEL CHARACTER
1.	Here we have declared a struct taking variables of name, age and favMarvelCharacter of type string, uint, string respectively.
2.	We declare an empty array of Students with visibility public and variable as student.
3.	Using mapping function the _name string is mapped to the _marvel string.
4.	Now, we create a function of addPerson which takes parameters of _name, _age and _marvel.
5.	The values are pushed to the Students array using push function.
6.	On calling the _name variable, the fav marvel character will be obtained.
